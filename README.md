# Kotlin Android TV ‚ÄúNetflix‚Äù Clone

A polished, production-ready reference app for Android/Google TV built with Kotlin. It demonstrates a modern TV streaming UX (home rows, details, playback, search, profiles) using Jetpack libraries, Clean Architecture, and ExoPlayer‚Äîready to plug into your own catalog API (e.g., TMDB) or a backend you control.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prereqs

* Android Studio Jellyfish/Koala+
* JDK 17
* Android TV emulator *or* physical device (Chromecast with Google TV, Shield, etc.)

### 1) Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kotlin-tv-netflix-clone.git
cd kotlin-tv-netflix-clone
```

### 2) Configure Secrets

Create `local.properties` (or use Gradle properties/`dotenv`) and set your API keys:

```
TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://your.backend/api/
```

Optionally add Firebase `google-services.json` to `app/` if you enable analytics/crashlytics.

### 3) Run

```bash
./gradlew :app:installDebug
adb shell monkey -p com.yourorg.tvclone 1
```

Or use **Run** ‚ñ∂ in Android Studio on an **Android TV** device/emulator.

---

## üß≠ Flavors

* `composeTv` (default): Jetpack **Compose for TV**
* `leanback`: classic **Leanback** fragments

Switch with Build Variants or:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleComposeTvDebug
./gradlew :app:assembleLeanbackDebug
```

---

## üéÆ Remote Controls & Key Mapping

| Action            | Key / Button                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Move focus        | DPAD\_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT               |
| Select            | DPAD\_CENTER / ENTER                   |
| Back              | BACK                                   |
| Play/Pause        | MEDIA\_PLAY\_PAUSE                     |
| Fast Seek ¬±       | MEDIA\_FAST\_FORWARD / MEDIA\_REWIND   |
| Next/Prev episode | MEDIA\_NEXT / MEDIA\_PREVIOUS          |
| Info / Details    | BUTTON\_Y (controllers), long-press OK |

Focus is handled via Compose for TV `Focusable` + custom scale/shine effects. Components have large touch targets (‚â• 48dp) and clear focus rings.

---

## üì∫ UI/UX Notes

* Rails use **LazyRow** with snap & center zoom.
* Title cards preload artwork on focus for instant details panel.
* Details page shows: synopsis, metadata chips, cast, season picker, episodes list, and ‚ÄúMore like this‚Äù.
* Player overlay: timeline with thumbnails, CC/Audio button, ‚ÄúNext episode in 5‚Ä¶‚Äù, intro/recap skip hooks.
* Kids profile uses restricted catalog + simplified palette.

---

## üîä Voice & Search

* Text search: query suggestions + debounced results with Paging 3.
* Voice: integrates with **TV Assistant** via `android.intent.action.SEARCH` and `SearchableInfo`.
* Recommendations: **Watch Next** and **Channels** via `TvContractCompat` and `Recommendation` APIs.

---

## üé• Playback (ExoPlayer)

* DRM-ready (Widevine L3/L1; plug your license server).
* HLS/DASH with adaptive ABR; cue points for intro/credits.
* Subtitle formats: WebVTT/TTML/SRT (muxed or sidecar).
* Persisted resume positions and per-profile watch history.

---

## üîê Auth & Profiles (Optional)

* Email/pass or OAuth provider (Google Sign-In TV).
* Multiple profiles with content restrictions (kid/teen/adult).
* DataStore for local profile prefs; tokens stored in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`.

---

## üß™ Testing

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
./gradlew :benchmark:connectedCheck
```

* Unit: ViewModels, UseCases, Repos (MockK, Turbine for Flows)
* UI: Compose testing, Espresso for Leanback flavor
* Performance: Startup, scroll/jank, cold/warm launch benchmarks

---

## üìà Analytics & Quality

* Optional Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics hooks (events: play\_start, play\_complete, add\_to\_watchlist, search\_query)
* StrictMode + baseline profiles
* Detekt + Ktlint + ktfmt
* Proguard/R8 rules included

Run static checks:

```bash
./gradlew detekt ktlintCheck
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

`app/src/main/assets/remote_config.json` (example):

```json
{
  "hero_autoplay": true,
  "max_rows": 12,
  "enable_kids_profile": true,
  "enable_voice_search": true
}
```

---

## üåê Networking

* `Retrofit` + `OkHttp` with:

  * Auth & API-key interceptors
  * Disk cache (10‚Äì50 MB) and `Cache-Control` respect
  * Retry/backoff for flaky connections
* DTO ‚Üî Model mappers in `core-data`
* Replace `TMDBService` with your backend‚Äîonly `Repository` contracts are consumed by UI.

---

## üóÉ Offline & Caching

* Room entities for titles, images, seasons, episodes, continue-watching
* PagingSource combines local + remote (RemoteMediator)
* Poster/backdrop prefetch on focus to avoid jank
* Glide/Coil cache configured for TV memory constraints

---

## üîß Environment & Build

* Gradle Kotlin DSL, version catalogs `libs.versions.toml`
* BuildConfig flags per flavor:

  * `FEATURE_KIDS`, `FEATURE_RECOMMENDATIONS`, `FEATURE_VOICE`
* Keystore (release):

  * Place in `keystores/release.jks`, set in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

    ```
    RELEASE_STORE_FILE=keystores/release.jks
    RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=****
    RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=tvclone
    RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=****
    ```

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility

* High-contrast theme toggle
* Large focus ring & scale animations (motion-reduced variant)
* Content descriptions for cards & controls
* Subtitle styling, audio descriptions hook

---

## üß© Extensibility Ideas

* Downloads for offline (where permitted)
* Continue watching syncing across devices
* Multi-CDN failover
* Personalized rails (on-device ranking)
* Parental PIN & time limits

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Content & DRM

This project ships **no media**. Use your own catalog and ensure you have distribution rights. For DRM streams, configure Widevine license URLs in `PlaybackConfig`.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

* **No focus visible?** Verify you‚Äôre on a TV device (not phone), and `useTVFocus` modifiers are applied.
* **Stutter on hero row?** Reduce card elevation/blur, enable baseline profiles, check image sizes.
* **Voice search not working?** Confirm `SearchableActivity` intent filters and Assistant availability on device.
